         <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
         <ul>
           <li>Potatoes: Thinly sliced potatoes form the base of the dish</li>           </li>
           <li>Cream and Milk: A combination of cream and milk creates the rich and creamy texture.</li>
           <li>Cheese: Some recipes may include grated cheese, such as Gruyère or Parmesan, for added flavor and a cheesy crust.</li>
           <li>Garlic: Minced or crushed garlic can be added to enhance the overall flavor.</li>
           <li>Salt and Pepper: To season the dish to taste.</li>
           <li>Butter: Some recipes may call for butter, either for greasing the baking dish or incorporating into the cream mixture.</li>
         </ul>
           <h3>Quick Guide:</h3>
           <ol>
            <li>Prep Potatoes: Peel and thinly slice potatoes. Aim for uniform thickness to ensure even cooking.</li>
            <li>Prepare Cream Mixture: In a bowl, mix cream and milk. Optionally, add minced garlic for extra flavor.</li>
            <li>Layer Potatoes: Grease a baking dish and arrange a layer of sliced potatoes. Pour a portion of the cream mixture over the layer. Repeat until all potatoes are used.</li>
            <li>Season and Add Cheese: Sprinkle each layer with salt and pepper. If desired, add a layer of grated cheese for a cheesy crust.</li>
            <li>Bake: Place the dish in a preheated oven (around 375°F or 190°C) and bake until the potatoes are tender and the top is golden brown. This usually takes 50-60 minutes.</li>     
           <li>Check Doneness: Pierce the potatoes with a fork to ensure they are cooked through. If the top browns too quickly, cover it with foil and continue baking.</li>
          <li>Rest Before Serving: Allow the Kartoffelgratin to rest for a few minutes after removing it from the oven. This helps the flavors to settle.</li>
           <li>Serve and Enjoy: Slice and serve the Kartoffelgratin as a deliciously creamy and comforting side dish alongside your main course.</li>
